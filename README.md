# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I created this project to help me study the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. These four topics are instrumental in web development so it's important to know them well. These subjects contain many small details that this website will log to be easily looked up later.


## Installation

NA

## Usage

If you have a question about one of the four subjects, navigate to that section of the page and view the information under that subject's heading. The Console in DevTools is set to give you a random topic to study if general knowledge about the subjects is your goal.
